A fake microserver that sources data from wunderground (The Weather Underground).

In order for this to work, you will need to create a file called `api_key.js`
that contains the api key.  It should look like this:

```
module.exports = {
	api_key: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
}
```

where xxxxxxxxx is replaced with your api key.
